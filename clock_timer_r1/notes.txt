Enclosure size - splitting PCB up into three parts

Cutting holes without a dremel

Mounting enclosure screws up instead of screws down

Fitting LED display flush into the lid of the enclosure

Yellow wire...

74HC595 driving current limited

Lack of realtime clock module will mean clock drift

Only two leds harmed in the making

Late changes:
  Switches with LEDs in the enclosure require additional code
  Driving piezo buzzer with transistor instead of directly due to leakage noise
